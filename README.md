# Employee Loyalty Prediction Model

## Project Description

This project aims to build a predictive model that can identify the level of loyalty among employees within an organization. The model will use historical employee data to predict whether an employee will remain loyal or leave the company.

Additionally, this project includes the deployment of the model to Hugging Face, allowing practical usage of the model through an API.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of employee data, including various attributes such as age, tenure, position, salary, performance, etc. The dataset also includes labels indicating whether an employee remains loyal or leaves the company.

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Build an accurate predictive model for employee loyalty.
2. Provide an API endpoint using Hugging Face Transformers for practical model usage.

## Project Steps

The following are the steps to be taken in this project:

1. **Understanding the Dataset**: Understand the dataset, including descriptive statistics, data types, and handling missing data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data preprocessing such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling attributes if necessary.

3. **Model Building**: Build the employee loyalty prediction model using machine learning or deep learning algorithms.

4. **Model Training**: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Measure the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or others.

6. **Deployment to Hugging Face**: Integrate the model with Hugging Face Transformers to provide an API endpoint for user convenience.

7. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Provide conclusions from the project and discuss the potential use of the model within the organization.

## Notebook Usage

To use this notebook, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Transformers, and others. You can install them using pip or conda.

## Deployment to Hugging Face

The model developed in this project will be documented and deployed to the Hugging Face Transformers Hub, making it accessible through an API if needed.
